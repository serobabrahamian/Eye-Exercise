# Moving-Eyes

In this project we use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create two images that look like a set of eyes. With the JavaScript code, the set of eyeballs follow the mouse-pointer wherever it goes on the web-browser. You may easily change the colors and other styling related things with the CSS document. The HTML document creates a few divs in order to make sure the eyes are centered, next to each other, and so it works properly when minimizing the size of the window on a PC. The Javascript file, provides the code in order to have the eyeballs follow the mouse-pointer.
