# Moving-Eyes

In this project we use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create two images that look like a set of eyes. With the JavaScript code, the set of eyeballs follow the mouse-pointer wherever it goes on the web-browser. You may easily change the colors and other styling related things with the CSS document. The HTML document creates a few divs in order to make sure the eyes are centered, next to each other, and so it works properly when minimizing the size of the window on a PC. The Javascript file, provides the code in order to have the eyeballs follow the mouse-pointer.

## Running and Installation

In order to run the project please follow the following steps:

1 - download everything in the repository

2 - open the index file

3 - hover over screen

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

One main improvement that can be done to this project is to write such code that when the mouse-pointer is in the middle of both eyes, the eyes would act independently of one another and get the eyes to be in a cross-eyed state.
